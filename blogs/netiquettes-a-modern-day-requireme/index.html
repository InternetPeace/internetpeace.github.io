            <p>Oh hello there! It‚Äôs wonderful of you to be here reading our work like this.Probably ended up here because you heard about us from a friend, a colleague, or maybe you just stumbled upon us! so I‚Äôm assuming you probably have access to the internet? In this pandemic ridden world, almost every aspect of social as well as professional life have been shifted to online platforms and digital mediums. No more ok boomer, y‚Äôall! Almost every one of every age now has at least basic access and knowledge of how the internet works. And hence, it is imperative, now, more than ever to have everybody up to date with something really basic social behavior codes and etiquettes!</p>
<p>Well, look no further- here‚Äôs a basic guide to being a sensible, responsible and sensitive member of the online community. Follow these simple guides and you‚Äôre well on your way to not being a douchebag online üòä</p>
<p>Firstly,</p>
<h4 id="be-respectful">Be respectful</h4>
<p>We‚Äôve been taught this for as long as we can remember: Treat people with the kind of respect that you want to be treated with. Who doesn‚Äôt appreciate kindness and respect? And believe us, it‚Äôs not hard. Respect others‚Äô opinions, their life experiences, their emotions and the way they choose to live and deal with life. Everyone‚Äôs having a hard time. Why make it harder for them? If you have specific opinions and advice, be polite about it, they have the right to not take your advice okay? And if you don‚Äôt have anything constructive to say, leave them alone.</p>
<h4 id="dont-say-things-that-you-normally-wouldnt">Don‚Äôt say things that you normally wouldn‚Äôt</h4>
<p>We get it. Hiding behind a screen and having a keyboard at your disposal is all very convenient.</p>
<p>But if you won‚Äôt openly insult or bully people because you understand that it‚Äôs against societal norms and guidelines, why not apply that online too? These are real people with real emotions irrespective of whether or not you physically see them.</p>
<h4 id="make-your-identity-clear-make-sure-you-can-identify-the-people-youre-interacting-with">Make your identity clear, make sure you can identify the people you‚Äôre interacting with</h4>
<p>Please, do the rest of us a favor, be yourself. Don‚Äôt go around creating fake accounts in order to fulfill your ‚Äúmysterious internet batman‚Äù fantasies, or impersonating people to damage their rep. Who likes cat phishes anyway? Be cool, be you.</p>
<p>And know who is safe. We all like internet friends. This one person you connect with, who empathizes with you, makes you feel like you have a dependable friend when all your irls are unavailable. But oftentimes, people, mostly teens and young kids get swayed by anyone who offers just one sweet word. Now, not everyone‚Äôs a cat phish, not everyone is looking to dupe you, bully or exploit you, but always make sure that people you‚Äôre interacting with are safe.</p>
<p>Which brings us to our next netiquette:</p>
<h4 id="learn-to-identify-red-flags">Learn to identify red flags</h4>
<p>It‚Äôs really not always hard to know a manipulator or a bully, if you keep alert.</p>
<p>Does this person always try to pry into your personal life?</p>
<p>Are they asking questions that make you uncomfortable, and continue to do so even after you clearly state that you don‚Äôt like it?</p>
<p>Not only children, but also parents can keep an eye out for such occurrences in their wards‚Äô lives. Ask your children what is causing them to feel upset every time they use the internet, why their health mental or physical seems to be deteriorating. Help your children out by identifying, blocking and reporting, these perpetrators. DO NOT RESPOND to such people, your responses can be used against you in the future. Collect evidence such as screen shots in order to report these people.</p>
<h4 id="dont-be-intrusive">Don‚Äôt be intrusive</h4>
<p>Just like you should be careful about divulging sensitive information about yourself on the web, be mindful of what you ask people for. Don‚Äôt ask things like people‚Äôs home or workplace addresses, their current locations, their bank details, pictures, people they associate with, what their love life is like etc, unless they volunteer that information themselves, because they trust you. Don‚Äôt expect your online friends to plan their schedules around you either. Be respectful of their time and how they choose to spend it. And please! Stop moral policing people!</p>
<h4 id="think-and-review-before-posting-or-reposting-anything">Think and review before posting or reposting anything</h4>
<p>The Internet is overflowing with information. It is very difficult to know what is authentic or not. Hence, make sure you verify the truth behind everything that YOU post. (No, websites like quora, reddit or Wikipedia, DON‚ÄôT count as authentic sources) Use official news outlets and sources.</p>
<p>Remember, misinformation can lead things, right from you turning up to the wrong venue for your own party, to harming social causes and movements, and can incite prejudice and undue hate against entire communities.</p>
<h4 id="be-open-minded">Be open minded</h4>
<p>The internet brings together all sorts of people, from different countries, races, religions, gender identities, sexualities, mental health conditions etc. all of them are here to connect with people like them, to express themselves, have their voices heard. Respect them. So what if their lifestyle or world is different from yours? Doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre wrong. Don‚Äôt go hating and reprimanding people for things they can‚Äôt control, for things that make THEM happy. If a type of content doesn‚Äôt appeal to you, leave. Look for what makes YOU happy, spread positivity there. We have too much undeserved hate in this world anyway, make sure that you‚Äôre not feeding the fire üòä</p>
<p>And there you go! We hope you‚Äôre a little more educated about some of the most basic etiquettes while on the web. Surf away!</p>
