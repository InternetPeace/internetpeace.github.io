<p>Social media can be a fun and scary place. Fun as in you can meet new people all around the world and scary because again, you can meet people from all around the world.</p>
<p>A lot of time we hesitate on posting a certain picture of ourselves. Why? We just don&rsquo;t want other people on social media to make fun of us. But have you ever thought of it? If you&rsquo;re okay with looking the way you look in real life then why don&rsquo;t you like to put the same you on social media?<br>
The answer to that question is simple, very simple.</p>
<p>There is a large chunk of people out on social media ready to bash you.</p>
<p>You might be skinny, oh my god they have a problem.<br>
You might be fat, they have a problem again.<br>
You decided to eat something different for breakfast; they have a problem.</p>
<p>Under the comments section of every individual with a good amount of following, there is always a comment that either body shames them or &lsquo;disapproves&rsquo; their choices in life.</p>
<p>Okay, understandable that the internet these days has tailored in a way that people can put their opinions out and let their voices be heard but that really doesn&rsquo;t mean you are allowed to make fun of others.<br>
This same &lsquo;making fun of others online&rsquo; is termed cyberbullying, which I&rsquo;m sure we all have an idea what it is.</p>
<p>The general public might not really have any idea what goes on in the mind of the person getting cyber bullied.</p>
<p>For an individual, especially the ones who make a living out of social media, every comment and like matters, and that&rsquo;s why a single negative comment affects the person on a personal level.</p>
<p>A hate comment online can range from just an &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like the way you look/dress up&rsquo; to straight-up &lsquo;death threats&rsquo;</p>
<p>Their mental health is the main concern when we talk about cyberbullying as you know. An individual goes through a lot mentally while dealing with bullying online.</p>
<p>Because of the same, many people go through extreme depression, social anxiety, trauma, and even if it is cured, PTSD because of past events. Studies have proven that cyberbullying has more effect on a child&rsquo;s mental health than the conditions it has been through (even for the ones with a dark and serious past).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s even more concerning since the symptoms of suffering by the victims are often not noticed and the harassment is continued by the bully under a concealed identity.</p>
<p>To sum it up altogether, cyber bullying affects a person&rsquo;s mental health seriously and it often goes unnoticed.</p>
<p>If you need any sort of help, don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for it, we, at Internet Peace will always be down to help.</p>
<p>And one more thing please #StopCyberBullying</p>
